this is a html server that allows for the request of files
--root directory

to activate venv enter: source bin/activate

to  run : python3 web_server.py  
    (optional --root directory)
make requests etc


I wasn't 100% sure about what to do incircumstances where an
existing directory was reached but no index.txt or html it seems
that 404 is apropriate.

also i said if some one is doing /../ they are in forbiden zone!
no snoopers allowed 

i wasnt sure how to make sure image files were read acurately but i 
tried my best

also I was having trouble wih xforwarding so it was very hard to check
if my code was working
